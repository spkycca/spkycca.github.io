							<td>Motherboard</td>
							<td>The motherboard is the main component<br> in a computer. It is in charge of connecting<br> almost every part in a computer. Without<br> a motherboard, it is impossible for a <br>normal computer to run.</td>
							<td><strong>Low End</strong> Motherboard: Starting at <strong>~$100</strong><br><br><strong>High End</strong> Motherboard: Starting at <strong>~$210</strong></td>
							<td>A motherboard is somewhat delicate, though it can withstand some heat<br> and force, it is not have substantial stength. <br> However, motherboards can easily be damaged and destroyed <br> if bent or  comes into contact with water.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fYj9DRJ.png" width="290px" height="180px"></td>
							<td>Hard Drive</td>
							<td>A hard drive is the most popular <br>method of storing permanent data.<br>Your computer most likely using a HDD<br>(Hard Drive) in order to store data. This <br>data includes things such as software<br> and operating systems.</td>
							<td><strong>Low End</strong> HDD: Starting at <strong>~$80</strong><br><br><strong>High End</strong> HDD: Starting at <strong>~$180</strong></td>
							<td>A hard drive is completely encased. This makes is very durable as long as no liquids or unwanted substances get inside of the component.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><img width="290px" height="180px" src="http://i.imgur.com/yIUPtky.png"></td>
							<td>PCI Express Video Card</td>
							<td>The Video/Graphics card is in charge of<br>displaying the information on your monitor(s).<br> This part is very important as it allows for easy <br>user interaction. Video cards are also used for<br>operations such as bitcoin mining. However, <br>mining requires a proper video card. Most consumer grade and gaming cards will not work and will overheat easily.</td><br>
							<td><strong>Low End</strong> Graphics Card: Starting at <strong>~$80</strong><br><br><strong>High End</strong> Graphics Card Starting at <strong>$700</strong></td>
							<td>Depending on the card, video cards <br>can range from delicate to tough. Some <br>lower end cards are not encased, making them easily damaged by heat, <br>liquid, other subtances or drops.<br> Higher end cards are usually completely encased. These encased cards also hgave fans in them, allowing the card to run better without overheating.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><img width="290px" height="180px" src="http://i.imgur.com/P0jf9U8.png"></td>
							<td>Power Supply</td>
							<td>The power supply allows the computer to run. It supplies electricity to all parts of a computer. This includes parts such as the CPU, the Video Card and the Motherboard. Without a power supply, a computer cannot run.</td>
							<td><strong>Low End</strong> Power Supply: Starting at <strong>~$50</strong><br><br><strong>High End</strong> Power Supply: Starting at <strong>~$90</strong></td>
							<td>Power supplies, or PSUs, are very <br>durable parts. As long as nothing unwanted enters the unit, and it is properly cooled, the PSU will last a<br> fair bit of time. It is a larger part and can be very heavier compared to other parts.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><img width="290px" height="180px" src="http://i.imgur.com/e9vaphG.png"></td>
							<td>DVD Drive</td>
							<td>The DVD Drive is a component that allows the computer to read, download, retrieve and send things to a DVD. Although it is not a needed part in a computer, it can be very useful.</td>
							<td><strong>Low End</strong> Starting at <strong>~$25</strong><br><br><strong>High End</strong> Starting at <strong>~$45</strong></td>
							<td>Finally, DVD Drives are another very <br>stable and tough part. They are <br>completely encased, unless the tray is out. Again, if nothing unwanted enters the drive, it should last quite a while as it is a very tough component of a computer.</td>
